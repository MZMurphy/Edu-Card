# Edu-Card

Edu-Card is a flashcard application inspired by Anki. It is designed to help you with memorizing and learning new information through a flashcard-based study approach.

## Initial Commit

The initial commit of this project marks the beginning of GUI creation. During this phase, the following components were created:

- Root container: The main application window.
- Buttons: Interface elements to interact with the application.
- Frame/Canvas: Containers for organizing and displaying flashcards and study materials.

In the coming development stages, Edu-Card will be further enhanced to include features for creating, managing, and studying flashcards, making it a valuable tool for your educational needs.

Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
