# Edu-Card

Edu-Card is a flashcard application inspired by Anki. It is designed to help you with memorizing and learning new information through a flashcard-based study approach.

## Initial Commit

The initial commit of this project marks the beginning of GUI creation. During this phase, the following components were created:

- Root container: The main application window.
- Buttons: Interface elements to interact with the application.
- Frame/Canvas: Containers for organizing and displaying flashcards and study materials.

## Note: 

Edu-card is my actually from 2021 - it's my first ever solo developed project. 

Sadly, I lost access to the original code as I only kept it locally on a now defunct machine. This is my reimplentation of that lost code.
